# Introduction
This is MienSwiper<sup>(*)</sup>, a game where you navigate through a grid board, swiping the cells until they are all swiped 🧹 Be careful though, you may swipe the MIEN cell, which explodes when swiped and kills you 💥💀
This is my first attempt<sup>(**)</sup> at making a game, so everything looks very messy 😭😭😭

<sup>(*)</sup> Totally not a rip-off of some very famous game with a relatively similar name
<sup>(**)</sup> It's my second attempt if the very old game I made in Scratch 🐱 back when I was 12 counts

# Features
- 3 presets for board configuration, and the ability to set a custom one 🛠
- Ability to set brightness 💡
- MOAI 🗿

# Compability
Sorry Linux/MacOS/Android/Whatever-OS-I-didnt-mention users, this program only runs in Windows 😥
